Aiven PG Security Utility
======================
Adds utility functions to harden PostgreSQLÂ® through shared libraries and hooks.

Overview
========
The Aiven Security Agent for PostgreSQL (aiven-gatekeeper) allows controlling which privileged functions are exposed and prevents their abuse in common privilege escalation attacks.

Features
============
Prevents common privilege escalation attacks, primarily at the time of extension creation. Limits access to sensitive features and functions within PostgreSQL and compliments the existing grants and superuser checks.

For detailed features and how they work, visit the [documentation](docs/).
